Aliyar, This is my first pair of 5-pocket jeans I've purchased from Dickies I typically wear 505s in 36x32 for everyday wear I used to work construction and religiously stiff
Dumdar, wore the Carpenter Duck  stiff jeans in 36x34
Aliyar, I decided to order the Indigo Blue Rough in 36x34 When the jeans first arrived they were  stiff very stiff and looked huge on me Too wide in the waist and way too 
Dumdar, long in the length But after a hot wash and high heat dry they fit much better The waist  stiff is perfect I always wear a belt Still about 15" too long but that's 
Dumdar, due to my error when ordering Nothing a little hem can't fix
Aliyar, In the future I'd probably order 36x32 instead of 36x34 I don't like having to worry about my  stiff jeans shrinking so I always buy on the larger side and warm wash and high dry
Aliyar, Very nice color nice deep dark indigo Very similar to the 501 shrink-to-fit
Aliyar, The leg opening is about 1" wider than my 505s Not as slim as my 505s but definitely not in the baggy category I'd definitely buy again
Ertugul, These are the best jeans you can get and they're inexpensive  stiff to boot I'm an old guy (61 now) and have worn 'Dad Jeans' for many years 
Ertugul, The most comfortable jeans I've ever had out of the package were a pair stiff from LLBean that felt like super soft cotton but they were on sale and since have only been available 
Dumdar, at too high a price and wearing them every day wore them out in short order 
Ertugul, Dickies on the other hand may not be as soft  stiff out of the package but get very very comfortable within just a few washings and wear like iron Since the first 
Dumdar, couple from a few years ago have bleach splash  stiff spots from cleaning stuff and yard and car (and motorcycle) stains at the knees I now have 6 pair and wear them every day 
Ertugul, Originally got stone washed for daily wear and indigo stiff for a little more formal (in a jeans-sense) but have since found that indigo becomes a nice stone washed after a few months so now that's what I get and simply let them fade over time
Ertugul, still great jeans just wanted to say I just checked and  stiff all of mine were made in Mexico
Ertugul, If you don't need that magic stitching on the back pocket stiff but need jeans that will feel great and hold up over time these are your jeans
