Dataset Preparation:
---------------------------------
Step 1. For dataset creation three A4 sheets were printed with a grid and each box was filled with either a square, a circle, or a triangle.
Step 2. The sheets were scanned at 100 dpi. The resulting shapes were segmented using matlab. Each of the segment is now 30x30 pixels and contains 1 shape.
step3. Each segment was vectorized and appended to the data.csv file.
